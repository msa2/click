Introduce new elements for building a proper RFC-4301 and
Key Management support. This is still work in progress and
at the goal has been in building a framework that can be
completed without breaking the interfaces between elements.

Depends on IP6Address, so this must be configured with --enable-ip6.
Only for usermode, does not compile in kernel module due to use
of dynamic_cast (can probably be avoided with some addon work).

This introduces four new main elements:

 IPsec - provide the RFC-4301 implementation

 IPsecInbound - inbound IPsec frontend. Peeks into IP packet and
                routes to selected output port depending on the IPsec
                requirements.

 IPsecKM - IPsec Key manager stub, which can be used as a base for
  	   writing adapters to real IKE or other experimental key
  	   exchange implementations.

 IPsecTransform - holds IPsec transform proposal information (and
 		  works as a first element in the element pipe line,
 		  which implements the transform it described).

 IPsecAdapter - is derived from IPsecTransform and adapts this new
                framework for the old IPsec encryption and
                authentication elements (converts new SA into
                SADataTuple)

And following supporting information type elements:

 IPsecSelector - IPsec selector
 IPsecPolicyAction - Policy parameters for IPsec processing
 IPsecSAData - Manual/fixed SA data (spi, key, algorithms) for IPsec
